The Procaptcha plugin extends the following [Beaver Builder](https://elementor.com/) form elements:

## 1. Contact form

To enable protection for the [Contact form](https://docs.wpbeaverbuilder.com/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/contact-form/):

1. Edit the target page with the desired form element.
2. Click edit on the form element.
3. In the General section, opt for the "Enabled" option in the "Procaptcha protection" field.
4. Save the page.

## 2. Subscribe form

To enable protection for the [Subscribe form](https://docs.wpbeaverbuilder.com/beaver-builder/2.9/layouts/modules/subscribe-form/):

1. Edit the target page with the desired form element.
2. Click edit on the form element.
3. In the General section, opt for the "Enabled" option in the "Procaptcha protection" field.
4. Save the page.

## 3. Login form

Unlike the forms above, the [login form](https://docs.wpbeaverbuilder.com/beaver-builder/2.9/layouts/modules/login-form) doesn't have a separate Procaptcha setting.

Instead, it's controlled via the generic Procaptcha settings:

1. Visit Procaptcha plugin settings
2. Switch to the "Account forms" tab
3. Enable login form protection
4. Save settings
