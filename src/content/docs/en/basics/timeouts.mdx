Custom timeouts can be specified for the length of time in which a user has to solve the CAPTCHA challenge. The defaults are as follows:

```typescript
const defaultCaptchaTimeouts = {
    image: {
        // The timeframe in which a user must complete an image captcha (1 minute)
        challengeTimeout: 60000,
        // The timeframe in which an image captcha solution remains valid on the page before timing out (2 minutes)
        solutionTimeout: 60000 * 2,
        // The timeframe in which an image captcha solution must be verified server side (3 minutes)
        verifiedTimeout: 60000 * 3,
        // The time in milliseconds that a cached, verified, image captcha solution is valid for (15 minutes)
        cachedTimeout: 60000 * 15,
    },
    pow: {
        // The timeframe in which a pow captcha solution remains valid on the page before timing out (1 minute)
        challengeTimeout: 60000,
        // The timeframe in which a pow captcha must be completed and verified (2 minutes)
        solutionTimeout: 60000 * 2,
        // The time in milliseconds that a Provider cached, verified, pow captcha solution is valid for (3 minutes)
        cachedTimeout: 60000 * 3,
    },
}
```

To specify timeouts using API verification, pass the above object in a field called `timeouts`, implementing one or more of the timeouts.

```typescript
// send a POST application/json request to the API endpoint
response = POST('https://api.prosopo.io/siteverify', {
    ...
    timeouts: defaultCaptchaTimeouts, // add timeouts object here
})
```

To specify timeouts using the verification package, pass the above object in the `timeouts` field of the `ProsopoServer` config, implementing one or more of the timeouts.

```typescript
config = { timeouts: defaultCaptchaTimeouts, ...config }
const prosopoServer = new ProsopoServer(config, pair)
```
