We welcome contributions of any size and contributors of any skill level. As an open-source project, we believe in giving back to our contributors. We are happy to help with guidance on PRs, technical writing, and turning any feature idea into a reality.

Want to get even more involved? See our [Governance doc](https://github.com/prosopo/.github/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md) for detailed descriptions of different roles, maintainer nomination processes, code review processes, and Code of Conduct enforcement.

## Ways to Contribute

### Project repositories

There are lots of ways to contribute to the Prosopo Project! Every Prosopo repository has a README with a link to a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the root of the project.

Visit [Prosopo's GitHub profile](https://github.com/prosopo) to find the repositories for:

- The [main Prosopo Procaptcha codebase](https://github.com/prosopo/captcha).

- [Prosopo Docs](https://github.com/prosopo/docs), an entire Prosopo website! Contribute not just written content, but also Prosopo code addressing a11y, CSS, UI, and UX concerns. We also make our documentation available in several languages, so we need help translating the entire site.

### Types of contributions

In addition to contributing your own code or content, you can also make a huge contribution by getting involved by leaving review comments on PRs, adding ideas in existing GitHub Issues and Discussions, and participating in our "Pinned" issue maintenance tasks!

Every PR, especially translation PRs, needs reviewers! Reviewing PRs and leaving comments, suggestions, or an approving "LGTM!" ("Looks Good To Me!") is a great way to get started in any repository, and to learn more about Prosopo.

We also have an active [Discord](https://discord.gg/3nMYAHecZT) community! We value the contributions of those who welcome new members, answer support questions.
