Context Awareness helps prevent your CAPTCHA from being used on forged or unexpected origins by applying environment-sensitive checks and a configurable sensitivity threshold. It increases challenge difficulty for suspicious contexts while allowing legitimate traffic to pass with minimal friction.

Context Awareness is not available on the Free tier. Please [upgrade](https://prosopo.io/pricing/) to access this functionality.


## What is Context Awareness?

Context Awareness compares runtime signals from incoming requests (origin, frame/embedding context, environment) to your expected site context. When discrepancies are detected, the system can raise verification difficulty or fail verification to reduce abuse from embedded or forged origins.

## How Context Awareness Works

### Detection Flow

1. **Request arrives** - The system gathers environment signals such as origin, embedding/frame status, and client indicators.
2. **Context comparison** - Signals are compared against the configured expected site context.
3. **Score & decision** - A contextual risk score is derived and evaluated against the selected sensitivity threshold.
4. **Action taken**:
- **Below threshold**: Normal verification (invisible PoW or light verification).
- **At or above threshold**: Increase CAPTCHA difficulty or fail verification (depending on controls).

## Controls

- Disallow Webview
Prevents successful verification from in-app webviews. Users can still complete CAPTCHAs, but verification fails if the request originates from a webview.

- Context Awareness (toggle)
Enables contextual checks that compare request environment signals to your expected site context. When enabled, the system may increase challenge difficulty for suspicious contexts.

- Threshold Slider (Low / Medium / High)
Three-position slider controlling sensitivity. Medium is recommended; Low is permissive, High is strict.

### Threshold Ranges

| Range | Label | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Low |  Permissive | Allows more solves; may permit fraudulent or embedded origins. |
| Medium |  Balanced | Recommended default — good tradeoff between UX and security. |
| High |  Strict | Blocks more suspicious contexts; may increase false positives. |

## Permissions & Behavior

- Free tier users cannot enable `Disallow Webview` nor `Context Awareness`. Attempting to toggle will show the upgrade CTA.
- Viewer mode renders controls read-only and displays an informational hint.

## Real-World Examples

- E-commerce: Start with Medium. During promotions, monitor traffic before lowering sensitivity to reduce friction. If under attack, raise to High temporarily.
- Embedded widget: If your site is intended to be embedded, avoid High sensitivity or explicitly whitelist integration contexts.

## Configuring Context Awareness

1. Log in to the Prosopo portal.
2. Navigate to your site settings.
3. Locate the "Context Awareness" section.
4. Toggle the feature and set the Threshold Slider to Low / Medium / High.
5. Save changes and monitor analytics to validate behavior.
