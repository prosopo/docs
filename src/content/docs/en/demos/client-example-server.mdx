This example server implements signup, login and authorisation methods for a typical node backend application. The code
is based
on [an article written by Agustin Fernandez](https://www.asapdevelopers.com/build-a-react-native-login-app-with-node-js-backend/)
and is adapted to use a Mongo In-Memory Database. This backend server integrates with the client-example React app.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prosopo/captcha && \
cd captcha && \
cp demos/client-example-server/env.production demos/client-example-server/.env.production && \
npm i && \
npm run -w @prosopo/scripts build && \
npm run start:server
```

Make sure you replace the following placeholders in the `.env.production` file with your own site key and secret key.
You can obtain these by logging into the [Prosopo portal](https://portal.prosopo.io).

```typescript
PROSOPO_SITE_KEY=<YOUR SITE KEY HERE>
PROSOPO_SITE_PRIVATE_KEY=<YOUR SECRET KEY HERE>
```

Run this example API in conjunction with
the [client-example](/en/demos/client-example/) React app.
