This project is a _minimal_ example demonstrating how to include Prosopo Procaptcha in a client React app.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prosopo/captcha && \
cd captcha && \
cp demos/client-example/env.production demos/client-example/.env.production && \
npm i && \
npm run -w @prosopo/scripts build && \
npm run start:demo
```

Make sure you replace the following placeholder in the `.env.production` file with your own site key. You can obtain
this by logging into the [Prosopo portal](https://portal.prosopo.io).

```typescript
PROSOPO_SITE_KEY=<YOUR SITE KEY HERE>
```

The app is now running. Open [http://localhost:9230/frictionless](http://localhost:9230) to view it in the
browser. You also need
to [start the backend server](/en/demos/client-example-server/) to
test the verification process.
